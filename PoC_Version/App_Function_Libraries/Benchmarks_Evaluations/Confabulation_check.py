1. Coherence (1-5): How well-structured and organized is the summary?
2. Consistency (1-5): How factually aligned is the summary with the original transcript?
3. Fluency (1-3): How well-written is the summary in terms of grammar, spelling, and readability?
4. Relevance (1-5): How well does the summary capture the important information from the transcript?

Please provide a score for each criterion and a brief explanation for your scoring. Then, give an overall assessment of the summary's quality.

Original Transcript:
{transcript}

Summary to Evaluate:
{summary}

Please provide your evaluation in the following format:
Coherence: [score] - [brief explanation]
Consistency: [score] - [brief explanation]
Fluency: [score] - [brief explanation]
Relevance: [score] - [brief explanation]

Overall Assessment: [Your overall assessment of the summary's quality]
