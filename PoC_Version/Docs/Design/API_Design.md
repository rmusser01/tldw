# API Design

## Introduction
This is to track efforts regarding the design of the API for the project. The API is the interface that will be used to interact with the project.
It will be a REST-based API.

## API Design
The API will be designed to be RESTful. This means that it will be designed around resources and the actions that can be performed on those resources.

### Resources
The following resources will be available in the API:
- User
- Project
- Task
- Comment


### Endpoints
The following endpoints will be available in the API:
- `/media/` - base endpoint for all media-focused interactions
- `/search/` - base endpoint for all search-focused interactions
- `/status/` - base endpoint for all status-focused interactions
