A great way to make studying more efficient and convenient is to take a digital PDF textbook, split it into separate files for each chapter, and organize them individually. 
I then create a dedicated notebook for each chapter, treating it as a focused single source. 
From there, I convert each chapter into an audio format, like a podcast. 
This approach makes it easy to study while commuting, relaxing in bed with your eyes closed, or at any time when reading isn’t practical.

I also recommend creating a study guide for each chapter, fully breaking down key concepts and definitions. 
For more complex topics, the “explain like I’m 5” method works wonders—it simplifies challenging ideas into digestible explanations.

To take this further, incorporate a Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system into your routine. 
Apps like Obsidian are perfect for this, with their flexible folder structures and Markdown formatting. 
I optimize my AI outputs for Markdown so I can copy, paste, and organize them into clean, structured notes. 
This ensures your materials are not only well-organized but also easy to access and build on later. 
A solid PKM system is invaluable for managing knowledge and staying on top of your studies!
