Integration with external tools: Consider adding integrations with popular productivity tools, note-taking apps, or content management systems to allow for seamless workflow between your application and other platforms.
Version control for edited content
        Enhance your existing document versioning system with more robust features.
        Implementation ideas:
        
        Implement a Git-like versioning system for text content.
        Store diffs between versions instead of full copies to save space.
        Allow branching and merging of different content versions.
        Implement a visual diff tool to easily compare versions.
        
        Example in your app:

        Enhance your existing "Document Versions" table to include branching information.
        Create a new interface for visualizing the version history of a document, showing branches and merges.
        Allow users to easily switch between versions, create new branches, and merge changes.
Advanced content comparison: Implement more sophisticated tools for comparing different versions of content or comparing content across different sources.
        Implement more sophisticated tools for comparing different versions of content or comparing content across different sources.
        Implementation ideas:
        
        Use semantic similarity measures (e.g., cosine similarity of embeddings) to compare content beyond just text matching.
        Implement visualization tools to show differences in content structure, key points, or sentiment.
        Use named entity recognition and comparison to identify differences in mentioned entities.
        Implement cross-language comparison for multilingual content.

Expanded language support
Integration with academic tools: Consider adding features specifically tailored for academic research, such as citation generation or integration with reference management tools.
Sentiment analysis
        This feature would analyze the emotional tone of text content or transcribed audio/video.
        Implementation ideas:
        
        Use pre-trained sentiment analysis models (e.g., VADER, TextBlob, or fine-tuned transformers).
        Implement more nuanced emotion detection beyond just positive/negative/neutral.
        Analyze sentiment changes over time in longer pieces of content.
        Provide visualization of sentiment distribution across different content pieces.
        
        Example in your app:
        
        Add a sentiment score to each piece of content in your database.
        Create a new tab for "Sentiment Analysis" where users can view overall sentiment trends.
        Enhance your search functionality to filter content by sentiment.


Trend Analysis
        This feature would identify and visualize trends across your content over time.
        Implementation ideas:
        
        Implement keyword extraction and track frequency over time.
        Use topic modeling to identify emerging topics in your content.
        Analyze changes in sentiment or content categories over time.
        Implement named entity recognition to track mentions of specific people, places, or organizations.
        
        Example in your app:
        
        Create a "Trend Analysis" tab with interactive visualizations.
        Show graphs of keyword frequency, topic distribution, or sentiment changes over time.
        Allow users to compare trends across different content categories or time periods
