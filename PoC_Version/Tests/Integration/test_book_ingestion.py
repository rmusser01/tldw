# test_book_ingestion.py
# Integration test for book ingestion functionality
# Usage: pytest tests/integration/test_book_ingestion.py
# This test assumes that your ingest_text_file function handles the parsing of the book's metadata (title, author, keywords) from the file content. If your function doesn't do this, you might need to adjust the test or the function to handle this.
# The test doesn't check for things like chapter structure or more complex book formatting. Depending on your requirements, you might want to add more detailed checks.

Chapter 1: Introduction

This is a test book for integration testing.
It contains multiple lines and simulates a simple book structure.

Chapter 2: Content

The content of this book is not particularly meaningful.
It's just for testing the book ingestion process.

Chapter 3: Conclusion

This concludes our test book. Thank you for reading!
