# Test Status:
# working as of 2024-10-01 - This test checks the performance of the search_media_database function
# by populating the database with a specified number of records and measuring the time taken to search
# 10, 100, 1k, 10k records. The expected search time never exceeds 2s for 10k records.
# This can be/should be tuned down more.
